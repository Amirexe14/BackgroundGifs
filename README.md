# BackgroundGifs
A fun little project that is just "Wallpaper Engine" but for Freeeeee

# Hi! Dumb coder here!

Your neighbourhood coder has come to give you a simple python script that just makes your background move, aka in caveman words: "Background can become gif"
So have fun! There's nothing to change. Just input your file path and give it a random temporary file path to store the frames of that gif then BOOM done!

## How does it work?
- Pure magic, no one in the lab knows
- And luck, dont forget that

## Why make this?
- Why not, i just want to make stuff so why not make this
- Plus, it was a friend inspired idea, sooo thanks [REDACTED]

## So how do i install and run it?
### Okay skid, welp here's your tutorial:
- Click code, up there, that green button
- Select "Download ZIP"
- Wait for your shit pc to download it
- Extract it to your file path or something
- Run the python script ("Whats python?", open google and download "python 3.10" or something so you can run it)
